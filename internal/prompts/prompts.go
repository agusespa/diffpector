=== CODE CHANGES TO REVIEW ===
{{.}}

=== ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS ===

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY ACTUAL CHANGES:
- Look ONLY at lines starting with + (additions) or - (deletions) in the diff
- Ignore any reference context - it's for understanding only

STEP 2 - CLEAN REFACTORING CHECK:
Ask: "Does this change produce the SAME OUTPUT for the SAME INPUT?"
If YES ‚Üí This is clean refactoring ‚Üí RESPOND WITH "APPROVED"

STEP 3 - DETECT REAL ISSUES:
CRITICAL:
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, exposed credentials, authentication bypass)
- Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, resource leaks)
- Logic errors causing crashes or data corruption
- Concurrency issues (race conditions, removed synchronization)
WARNING:
- Performance problems (N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms)
- Missing error handling for operations that can fail
- Resource management issues (unclosed connections, files)
- Breaking API changes
MINOR:
- Significant readability problems

=== ANALYSIS PROCESS ===

STEP 1: IDENTIFY ACTUAL CHANGES
- Examine ONLY lines starting with + (additions) or - (deletions)
- Ignore unchanged lines and reference context
- Focus on what code is being added, removed, or modified

STEP 2: EVALUATE FOR ISSUES
Scan for these issue types in order of priority:

üî¥ CRITICAL (Security, crashes, data loss):
- SQL injection vulnerabilities (unparameterized queries)
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Exposed credentials, API keys, or secrets
- Buffer overflows or memory corruption
- Logic errors causing crashes or data corruption
- Removed error handling for critical operations

üü° WARNING (Performance, reliability):
- Performance degradation (N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms)
- Missing error handling for operations that can fail
- Resource leaks (unclosed connections, files, database handles)
- Concurrency issues (race conditions, missing synchronization)
- Breaking changes to public APIs

üîµ MINOR (Code quality):
- Significant readability problems that impact maintainability
- Missing input validation for user-facing functions
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
