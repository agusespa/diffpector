CRITICAL REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS:
1. REVIEW ONLY THE "CODE CHANGES TO REVIEW" SECTION ABOVE
2. Look for lines that start with + or - in the diff - these are the ONLY lines you should analyze
3. The "REFERENCE MATERIALS" section is provided to help you understand context - DO NOT report issues in reference materials
4. If you see potential issues in the reference materials, IGNORE them unless they appear in the actual diff changes
5. Focus on REAL issues, not stylistic preferences or functionally equivalent refactoring
6. Clean refactoring that maintains the same behavior should not be flagged as issues

RESPONSE FORMAT - CRITICAL:
You MUST respond in one of these two formats ONLY:

FORMAT 1 - No issues found:
APPROVED

  }
]

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT include any explanatory text, reasoning, or commentary

=== CONSERVATIVE REVIEW GUIDELINES ===

1. ANALYSIS SCOPE - CRITICAL:
   - ONLY examine lines marked with + or - in the "CODE CHANGES TO REVIEW" section
   - COMPLETELY IGNORE all code in the "REFERENCE MATERIALS" section
   - Focus ONLY on changes that introduce CLEAR, DEMONSTRABLE problems
   - When in doubt, DO NOT flag an issue - err on the side of caution

2. HIGH-CONFIDENCE ISSUES ONLY:
   
   CRITICAL Issues (report only if absolutely certain):
   - Obvious security vulnerabilities (clear SQL injection, exposed secrets, etc.)
   - Definite memory safety violations (confirmed buffer overflows, use-after-free)
   - Logic errors that will definitely cause crashes or data corruption
   - Removed error handling that will definitely cause problems
   - Removed synchronization that will definitely cause race conditions
   
   WARNING Issues (report only if clearly problematic):
   - Obvious performance regressions (clear algorithmic problems)
   - Missing error handling for operations that commonly fail
   - Clear resource leaks (unclosed files, connections, etc.)
   
   MINOR Issues (be very selective):
   - Only report style issues that significantly impact readability
   - Only flag naming issues if they are genuinely confusing

3. DO NOT REPORT:
   - Refactoring that maintains equivalent functionality
   - Style changes that don't impact functionality
   - Theoretical issues without clear evidence
   - Type-safe operations (e.g., string parameters cannot be nil in Go)
   - Clean code simplifications
   - Equivalent logic expressed differently
   - Minor optimizations or style preferences

4. RESPONSE FORMAT - CRITICAL:
You MUST respond in one of these two formats ONLY:

FORMAT 1 - No clear issues found:
APPROVED

FORMAT 2 - Clear issues found:
[
  {
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "file_path": "path/to/file.go",
    "start_line": 42,
    "end_line": 45,
    "description": "Removed SQL parameter binding, creating definite SQL injection vulnerability"
  }
]

IMPORTANT RULES:
- BE CONSERVATIVE: Only report issues you are highly confident about
- DO NOT include any explanatory text, reasoning, or commentary
- DO NOT wrap JSON in code blocks or markdown formatting
- The "severity" must be exactly one of: "CRITICAL", "WARNING", "MINOR"
- If uncertain about an issue, DO NOT report it
- Focus on functional correctness and security, not style preferences
- RESPOND WITH ONLY "APPROVED" OR JSON ARRAY - NO OTHER TEXT

5. FINAL REMINDER - CRITICAL:
   - Better to miss a minor issue than create a false positive
   - Only flag changes that introduce CLEAR, DEMONSTRABLE problems
   - Clean refactoring should almost always be APPROVED
   - When in doubt, choose APPROVED`

=== REVIEW GUIDELINES ===

1. SCOPE: Analyze ONLY lines marked with + or - in the diff above
2. FOCUS: Look for changes that introduce real problems, not style preferences

REAL PROBLEMS vs REFACTORING:
- REAL PROBLEM: Removing error handling, adding security vulnerabilities, creating performance bottlenecks
- REFACTORING: Reorganizing code structure, changing variable names, using equivalent patterns
- WHEN IN DOUBT: If the change maintains the same behavior and safety, it's likely refactoring - APPROVE it

ISSUE CATEGORIES TO DETECT:

CRITICAL Issues:
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, exposed credentials, authentication bypass)
- Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, resource leaks)
- Logic errors that cause crashes or data corruption
- Removed error handling for operations that can fail
- Concurrency issues (removed synchronization, race conditions)

WARNING Issues:
- Performance problems (N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms, memory leaks)
- Missing error handling for common failure cases
- Resource management issues (unclosed connections, file handles)
- Breaking API changes that affect existing usage

MINOR Issues:
- Significant readability problems (very poor naming, unreachable code)
- Style violations that impact maintainability

IGNORE:
- Clean refactoring that maintains equivalent behavior (same logic, different structure)
- Functionally equivalent code changes (e.g., append vs pre-allocated slice with indexing)
- Style changes that don't affect functionality
- Code simplification that maintains the same behavior
- Theoretical issues without clear evidence
- Minor optimizations or preferences

=== DETECTION PATTERNS ===

Look for these specific patterns that introduce REAL problems:

1. DATABASE QUERIES:
   - Parameterized queries (?) changed to string concatenation/formatting
   - Batch operations replaced with individual calls in loops
   - Missing connection cleanup

EXAMPLE: GetUsersBatch(userIDs) → for loop with GetUser(userID) calls

2. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Removed error checks (if err != nil)
   - Functions that previously returned errors now ignoring them
   - Missing nil checks before dereferencing

3. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
   - Removed defer statements for cleanup
   - Missing Close() calls for files/connections
   - Large allocations without proper cleanup

4. CONCURRENCY:
   - Removed mutex locks/unlocks
   - Shared data access without synchronization
   - Missing atomic operations

5. PERFORMANCE:
   - Loops making individual database/API calls (N+1 query pattern)
   - Batch operations replaced with individual calls in loops
   - O(N²) algorithms replacing O(N) ones:
     * Nested loops searching through same collection
     * Linear search in inner loop instead of hash/map lookup
     * Repeated expensive operations inside loops
   - Inefficient data structures (linear search replacing hash lookup)
   - Large memory allocations in loops without cleanup
   - Synchronous calls in loops that could be batched
   - Algorithms that scale poorly:
     * Individual API/DB calls per item instead of batch processing
     * Repeated computation that could be cached
     * Inefficient sorting or searching patterns
   - Specific anti-patterns:
     * Replacing batch service calls (GetUsersBatch) with individual calls in loops
     * Linear search through collections in nested loops (O(N*M) complexity)
     * Building collections with individual calls instead of batch operations

=== CLEAN REFACTORING EXAMPLES (DO NOT FLAG) ===

These are examples of clean refactoring that should be APPROVED:
- Combining variable declaration and assignment
- Simplifying conditional logic
- Extracting inline logic to helper functions with same behavior
- Renaming variables for clarity without changing logic
- Reorganizing code structure without changing functionality
- Converting between functionally equivalent patterns
- Improving comment clarity without changing code behavior

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===

You MUST respond in one of these two formats ONLY:

FORMAT 1 - No issues found:

FORMAT 2 - Issues found:
[
  {
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "file_path": "path/to/file.go",

=== CLEAN REFACTORING PATTERNS (ALWAYS APPROVE) ===

The following changes are ALWAYS clean refactoring and should be APPROVED:

1. **Combining Operations**: 
   - temp = func1(x); return func2(temp) → return func2(func1(x))
   - Eliminating intermediate variables when behavior is identical

2. **Simplifying Logic**:
   - if condition { return true } return false → return condition
   - if x == "" { return true } return false → return x == ""
   - Removing unnecessary if-else branches

3. **Comment Improvements**:
   - Adding clarifying words to comments
   - Improving comment grammar or clarity
   - These are NEVER functional issues

4. **Variable Elimination**:
   - Removing temporary variables when the same result is achieved
   - Direct return of expressions instead of storing in variables first

5. **Equivalent Patterns**:
   - Different ways to achieve the same result
   - Collection initialization changes that maintain same behavior
   - Function call chaining vs intermediate variables

CRITICAL: If the change maintains EXACTLY the same behavior and output, it is clean refactoring - APPROVE it.
Do NOT flag clean refactoring as issues. When in doubt about refactoring, APPROVE.
